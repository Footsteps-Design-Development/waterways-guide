              Image files must be  .jpg format and images wider than 500 pixels will be automatically re-sized during the upload process.<br>
              <br>
              Browse the file by clicking the browse button and navigating to 
              the file on your local hard disk.<br>

              <font color="#FF0000"><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b></font> Large files 
              of 1mb may take 1-2 minutes to upload. Once you have pressed 'Save' 
              the screen will remain until the file has been sent to the server 
              and it may seem that nothing is happening - <b>please let the upload 
                finish until the message appears</b>. <br>
              <br>
              Beware of jpeg files created on Apple Macs which are often 
              many times the size they need to be. Loading and resaving in PaintShop 
              Pro or a similar PC application is a simple to way to reduce the size.<br>
